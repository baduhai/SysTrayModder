# SysTrayModder
Script to make the Plasma system tray behave like a sidebar.

**What does this script do?**

Copies your pre-existing systemtray widget that comes bundled with Plasma, and edits it so that the height of the tray takes up the entire available vertical space, and makes it so that the tray pops out from either side of the screen.

**Why copy the bundled tray, and not make a new widget?**

Because then I would have to make a new version of the widget everytime there is an update, whereas with this solution, you can just run this sript again after the update to get latest features and security.

**How do I make it do its magic?**

Run SysTrayModder.sh and follow instructions.

**Currently tested on:**

- Plasma 5.18.4
